    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This program will allow users to choose between different advanced level workout programs.  My idea is to put this program on a web app, and bring it to several powerlifting gyms across NY/NJ.  This is more of a proof of concept, and has not been fully developed.  Speed workouts, are fully functional, however, heavy sets and custom workouts aren't.  If you choose speed sets, you should be able to let the program know what percentages, sets, reps, and exercises you would like to perform.  The program will print out what weights are needed to be lifted based on your desired presets.  Upon exit, the program will record your results, and add them to a custom file on cwd in your name.  It will also print the workout to a master file.  If you choose heavy and then choose pyramid.  The program should be functional once again, asking you for all the inputs needed in a pyramid set workout.  Pyramid sets are when you start at the bottom, work your way to a maximum, and then work your way back down to a minimum(I.E set_1: 300, set_2: 350, set:3 400, set_4: 350, set_5: 300) \n",
    "\n",
    "# Future goals\n",
    "+ I want to allow the application to provide visual monthly reports and feedback for users.  \n",
    "+ However, the real goal here is to provide enough functionality so that the user base would grow.  With a healthy enough user base, I would like to start trying to understand  what workouts are creating the most strength gains.  As such, the final product will need to ask for much more data than what we are looking at currently.  Some examples of things that need to be added\n",
    "    + Food intake and macro nutrient breakdown\n",
    "    + List of supplements taken\n",
    "    + Attempt to get an honest answer if any performance enhancers are being used\n",
    "    + sleep schedule, stress levels, etc...\n",
    "+ While there will be plenty of confounding variables to think about, I believe that this is a rather untapped field of data to explore.  \n",
    "+ As these gyms are more advanced in nature, I believe people will have less incentive to lie, specifically if they know it could lead to discovering which workout routines seem to provide the best results.  \n",
    "    + Still this would be a observational study, and rely on an honesty system, which should be noted\n",
