# Attempt To Scrape NYT For Term "domestic Terrorist"
+ I found a really useful guide to accessing NYT API here [http://www.storybench.org/working-with-the-new-york-times-api-in-r/](http://www.storybench.org/working-with-the-new-york-times-api-in-r/) 
+ shiny app for pw protection
+ The notebook goes through my evolution in understanding of how to interact with the Times website
+ Graphs and summary statistics are provided on the metadata yielded from webscrape

# Please see attached link [here](http://rpubs.com/justin_herman_42/430032) for executed script
# Conclusion
+ I really wanted to go further with this, and may do so at a later time.  
    + My idea here was to produce some sort of modern day Manufactoring consent type analysis of the NY Times
    + Combining this data with sentiment analysis, could lead to some understanding of the bias presented in one of the most respected newspapers in the world
