# Research question
+ Develop a model using linear regression to predict win rates in poker 
+ I play online poker professionally and what led me into the topic actually has to do with my Data Exploration class final project. Here is the link to that project. [Build Custom Poker Statistics Software](https://rpubs.com/justin_herman_42/385739).  
    + The short explanation for that I had to access my poker Postgres database, create a customized string of poker statistics, and automate the insertion of that string into my poker sites notes file.  
+ After querying my local Postgres DB and creating custom stats, I attempt to fit models to the data.
