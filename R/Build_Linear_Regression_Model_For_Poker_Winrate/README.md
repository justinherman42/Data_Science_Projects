# Research question
+ Develop a model using linear regression to predict winrates in poker 
+ I play online poker professionally and what led me into the topic actually has to do with my data 607 final. Here is the link to that project. [Data 607 Final](https://rpubs.com/justin_herman_42/385739).  
    + The short explanation is that I had to access my poker postgres database, create a customized string of poker statistics, and automate the insertion of that string into my poker sites notes file.  
    + After querying the db and creating custom stats, I realized I wanted to attempt to fit a model to the data.  Such a problem seemed perfect for this final project
  + While I doubt anything I discover will be a breakthrough, I would think poker players as a whole could find it useful.
